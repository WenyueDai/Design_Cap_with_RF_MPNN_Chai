1. First, collect several solenoid that has potential of forming rigid structure and bury charged residue inside. I will start with 3ult

2. Manually mutate the residues inside protein to harbor charged residue H D H D.

3. MPNN to sample sequences, create sequence weblog.

4. Filter the sequence use CD-hit, select by both diversity (cluster) and conservation (the sequence from each cluster)

5. Use chai to predict the structure of protein. 100 proteins in total

(3. RFdiffusion to partial diffuse the rest of the structure.)

4. Pyrosetta to repack the N and C terminus to V

5. RFdiffusion to generate capping structure

6. Motif with the bury charge unchanged
