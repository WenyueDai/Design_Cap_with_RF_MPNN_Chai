1. First, use 3ult as the starting point to design main body with 11, 13, 15, 17 loops

2. Cut the designed solenoid in half, find the center of mass of the two part of solenoid, draw a line in between. Let's call it line_half

3. The fixed residue in 3ult (HDHD) can also draw a line. Let call it residue_line

4. Calculate the angle between line_half and residue line

5. Filter the solenoid structure that has a angle of less than 30 degrees

6. Use pyrosetta to repack the first and last 10 residue into Valine.

7. Use RFdiffusion to generate the capping structure.

8. ProteinMPNN to keep the charged motif unmove but the surrounding residue change.
