1. First, screen in repeatDB database to find out if there is any solenoid that contains a opposite
charged residue buried inside protein (SASA<1, distance between two charged residue<10)

2. If I can find such solenoid, observe what is the properties that allow them bury such residues

3. Extract the property and build new solenoid mainbody using RFdiffusion harboring the property.

4. Use pyrosetta to repack the first and last 10 residue into Valine.

5. Use RFdiffusion to generate the capping structure.

6. ProteinMPNN to keep the charged motif unmove but the surrounding residue change.
